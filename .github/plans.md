# Production Readiness Punch List (v1 Framework Release)

Comprehensive checklist for making fin-infra production‑ready. Each section follows: Research → Design → Implement → Tests → Verify → Docs. We will not implement until reviewed; existing functionality will be reused (skipped) when discovered during research.

## CRITICAL: Repository Boundaries & Reuse Policy

**fin-infra is ONLY for financial data integrations.** It is NOT a backend framework.

### What fin-infra IS
- Financial provider integrations (banking, brokerage, market data, credit, tax)
- Financial calculations (cashflows, NPV, IRR, tax calculations)
- Financial data models (accounts, transactions, quotes, holdings)
- Provider adapters and normalization (symbol resolution, currency conversion)

### What fin-infra IS NOT (use svc-infra instead)
- ❌ Backend framework (API scaffolding, middleware, routing)
- ❌ Auth/security (OAuth, sessions, MFA, password policies)
- ❌ Database operations (migrations, ORM, connection pooling)
- ❌ Caching infrastructure (Redis, cache decorators, TTL management)
- ❌ Logging/observability (structured logging, metrics, tracing)
- ❌ Job queues/background tasks (workers, schedulers, retries)
- ❌ Webhooks infrastructure (signing, delivery, retry logic)
- ❌ Rate limiting middleware
- ❌ Billing/payments infrastructure (use svc-infra's billing module)

### Mandatory Research Protocol Before ANY New Feature

**BEFORE implementing ANY new functionality, follow this research protocol:**

#### Step 1: Check svc-infra Comprehensively
- [ ] Search svc-infra README for related functionality
- [ ] Check svc-infra source tree: `src/svc_infra/*/` for relevant modules
- [ ] Review svc-infra docs: `src/svc_infra/docs/*.md` for guides
- [ ] Grep svc-infra codebase for similar functions/classes
- [ ] Check svc-infra's easy_* builders and add_* helpers

#### Step 2: Categorize the Functionality
Determine if the feature is:
- **Type A (Financial-specific)**: Banking API, market data, credit scores, tax forms, cashflow calculations
  → Implement in fin-infra
- **Type B (Backend infrastructure)**: API scaffolding, auth, caching, logging, jobs, webhooks, DB
  → MUST use svc-infra; mark as `[~]` in plans
- **Type C (Hybrid)**: Financial feature that needs backend support (e.g., provider metrics)
  → Use svc-infra for backend parts; fin-infra only for provider-specific logic

#### Step 3: Document Research Findings
For each item in plans.md, add a research note:
```markdown
- [ ] Research: [Feature name]
  - svc-infra check: [Module found or "not applicable"]
  - Classification: [Type A/B/C]
  - Justification: [Why fin-infra needs it or why reusing svc-infra]
  - Reuse plan: [Specific svc-infra imports if Type B/C]
```

#### Step 4: Get Approval for Implementation
- **Type A**: Proceed with fin-infra implementation
- **Type B**: Mark `[~]` and document svc-infra import pattern
- **Type C**: Design document showing clear separation (fin-infra for data, svc-infra for infrastructure)

#### Step 5: Implementation Rules
If approved for fin-infra implementation:
- No duplication of svc-infra functionality
- Import svc-infra modules where needed
- Document integration patterns in examples/
- Add tests showing fin-infra + svc-infra working together

### Examples of Correct Reuse
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use svc-infra for backend concerns
from svc_infra.logging import setup_logging
from svc_infra.cache import cache_read, cache_write, init_cache
from svc_infra.http import http_client_with_retry

# ✅ CORRECT: fin-infra provides financial-specific logic
from fin_infra.banking import easy_banking
from fin_infra.markets import easy_market
from fin_infra.cashflows import npv, irr
```

### Examples of INCORRECT Duplication
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Don't reimplement caching (use svc-infra)
from fin_infra.cache import cache_decorator  # NO!

# ❌ WRONG: Don't reimplement logging (use svc-infra)
from fin_infra.logging import setup_logger  # NO!

# ❌ WRONG: Don't reimplement HTTP retry logic (use svc-infra)
from fin_infra.http import RetryClient  # NO!

# ❌ WRONG: Don't implement billing (use svc-infra.billing)
from fin_infra.billing import create_subscription  # NO!

# ❌ WRONG: Don't use generic FastAPI routers (use svc-infra dual routers)
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter()  # NO!
```

## Router & API Standards (MANDATORY FOR ALL CAPABILITIES)

### All fin-infra Routers MUST Use svc-infra Dual Routers
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Every fin-infra capability that exposes FastAPI routes MUST use svc-infra dual routers. Generic `fastapi.APIRouter` is FORBIDDEN.

#### Router Selection Matrix
| Use Case | Router Type | Import Path | Auth Level |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Public market data (quotes, history) | `public_router()` | `svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.public` | None |
| Banking with provider tokens (Plaid/Teller) | `public_router()` | `svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.public` | Custom dependency |
| User brokerage trades | `user_router()` | `svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.protected` | JWT/session required |
| User credit reports | `user_router()` | `svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.protected` | JWT/session required |
| Service webhooks | `service_router()` | `svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.protected` | API key required |
| Admin provider management | `roles_router("admin")` | `svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.protected` | Admin role required |

#### Implementation Checklist for Each Capability
Every `add_*()` helper (add_banking, add_market_data, add_brokerage, etc.) must:
- [ ] Use appropriate svc-infra dual router (public_router, user_router, service_router)
- [ ] Mount with `app.include_router(router, include_in_schema=True)`
- [ ] Use descriptive tags for OpenAPI organization (e.g., `tags=["Banking"]`)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Call `add_prefixed_docs()` to register landing page card
- [ ] Return configured provider instance for programmatic access
- [ ] Store provider on `app.state.{capability}_provider` for route access
- [ ] Handle provider instance OR provider name (string) parameter
- [ ] Document which router type was chosen and why

#### Correct Implementation Pattern
```python
def add_market_data(app: FastAPI, provider=None, prefix="/market") -> MarketDataProvider:
    """Wire market data provider to FastAPI app with routes."""
    from svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.public import public_router
    from svc_infra.api.fastapi.docs.scoped import add_prefixed_docs
    
    # Create or use provider
    if isinstance(provider, MarketDataProvider):
        market = provider
    else:
        market = easy_market(provider=provider)
    
    # Create dual router (NOT generic APIRouter)
    router = public_router(prefix=prefix, tags=["Market Data"])
    
    @router.get("/quote/{symbol}")
    async def get_quote(symbol: str):
        return market.quote(symbol)
    
    # Mount with OpenAPI visibility
    app.include_router(router, include_in_schema=True)
    
    # Register scoped docs for landing page card (REQUIRED)
    add_prefixed_docs(
        app,
        prefix=prefix,
        title="Market Data",
        auto_exclude_from_root=True,
        visible_envs=None,  # Show in all environments
    )
    
    # Store for route access
    app.state.market_provider = market
    return market
```

#### Benefits of Dual Routers
1. **Consistent auth**: Pre-configured dependencies (RequireUser, RequireService, AllowIdentity)
2. **No 307 redirects**: Automatic handling of trailing slash variants
3. **Better OpenAPI**: Security schemes show lock icons appropriately
4. **Standard responses**: Pre-configured 401/403/500 responses
5. **Pattern consistency**: Matches svc-infra payment/auth/admin modules

#### Landing Page Cards via `add_prefixed_docs()`
**CRITICAL**: Every capability must call `add_prefixed_docs()` to register its own documentation card on the landing page.

What `add_prefixed_docs()` does:
1. **Creates landing page card**: Appears like /auth, /payments, /admin cards in svc-infra
2. **Generates scoped OpenAPI schema**: `{prefix}/openapi.json` with only capability routes
3. **Provides dedicated Swagger UI**: `{prefix}/docs` shows only capability docs
4. **Provides dedicated ReDoc**: `{prefix}/redoc` for alternative docs view
5. **Excludes from root docs**: Routes removed from root `/docs` (keeps root clean)
6. **Environment filtering**: `visible_envs` controls which environments show the card

Without this call:
- ❌ Routes work but don't appear as cards on landing page (`/`)
- ❌ Capability hidden in root docs instead of having dedicated docs
- ❌ No scoped OpenAPI schema for capability
- ❌ Harder to discover and navigate capability docs

Example usage (already in add_banking and add_market_data):
```python
from svc_infra.api.fastapi.docs.scoped import add_prefixed_docs

add_prefixed_docs(
    app,
    prefix="/banking",           # Matches router prefix
    title="Banking",             # Card title on landing page
    auto_exclude_from_root=True, # Remove from root docs
    visible_envs=None,           # Show in all envs (or specify [LOCAL_ENV, DEV_ENV])
)
```

### Documentation Card Requirements (MANDATORY FOR ALL CAPABILITIES)

Each capability must have complete documentation at multiple levels:

#### 1. README Card
Every capability needs a section in main README with:
- [ ] Overview (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Quick start example (3-5 lines of code)
- [ ] Key use cases (bullet list)
- [ ] Link to detailed docs

Example:
```markdown
### 🏦 Banking & Account Aggregation
Connect to 16,000+ financial institutions via Plaid, Teller, or MX. Fetch balances, transactions, and identity data.

Quick start: `banking = easy_banking(provider="teller")`

Use cases: Account linking, transaction sync, balance checks, identity verification
[Full docs →](docs/banking.md)
```

#### 2. Dedicated Documentation File
Each capability needs `docs/{capability}.md` with:
- [ ] Comprehensive feature overview
- [ ] Supported providers comparison table
- [ ] Configuration options (env vars, parameters)
- [ ] Complete API reference (all methods, parameters, return types)
- [ ] Integration examples with svc-infra
- [ ] Error handling guide
- [ ] Rate limits and quotas
- [ ] Production checklist

#### 3. OpenAPI Visibility
Routes must appear in FastAPI docs (`/docs`) with:
- [ ] Proper tags for grouping (e.g., "Banking", "Market Data")
- [ ] Security schemes shown correctly (lock icons)
- [ ] Request/response models documented
- [ ] Example values in schemas
- [ ] Success and error responses listed

Verification: Visit `/docs` and confirm capability has its own card/section.

#### 4. Architecture Decision Records (When Applicable)
For significant architectural choices, create `docs/adr/{number}-{title}.md`:
- [ ] Provider selection rationale
- [ ] Auth flow decisions
- [ ] Data model choices
- [ ] Integration patterns
- [ ] Security considerations

Examples:
- `docs/adr/0003-banking-integration.md` (token storage, PII handling)
- `docs/adr/0004-market-data-integration.md` (provider fallback chains)

#### 5. Integration Examples
Show real-world usage in `examples/` or main docs:
- [ ] Minimal example (standalone usage)
- [ ] Full integration (with svc-infra auth/cache/db)
- [ ] Production patterns (error handling, retries, monitoring)
- [ ] Testing examples (mocking providers)

#### Documentation Verification Checklist
Before marking capability as complete:
- [ ] README card exists with quick start
- [ ] Dedicated doc file covers all features
- [ ] Capability appears in `/docs` with proper card
- [ ] ADR written if architectural decisions made
- [ ] Integration examples show fin-infra + svc-infra
- [ ] All endpoints documented with request/response models
- [ ] Error scenarios covered
- [ ] Production considerations documented

### Target Applications
fin-infra enables building apps like:
- **Mint**: Personal finance management, account aggregation, budgeting
- **Credit Karma**: Credit monitoring, score tracking, financial health
- **Robinhood**: Brokerage, trading, portfolio management
- **Personal Capital**: Wealth management, investment tracking
- **YNAB**: Budgeting with bank connections and transaction imports

For ALL backend infrastructure needs (API, auth, DB, cache, jobs), these apps use svc-infra.

## Universal Capability Requirements (Apply to ALL Sections)

Every financial capability implementation (Banking, Market Data, Brokerage, Credit, Tax, etc.) MUST satisfy these requirements before being marked complete:

### 1. Router Implementation (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Use svc-infra dual router** (NEVER generic `fastapi.APIRouter`)
- [ ] **Select appropriate router type**:
  - `public_router()` for public data (market quotes) or provider tokens (banking)
  - `user_router()` for user-authenticated actions (brokerage trades, credit reports)
  - `service_router()` for webhooks or service-to-service calls
  - `roles_router("admin")` for admin operations
- [ ] **Import from correct path**: `from svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.{public|protected} import {router_type}`
- [ ] **Mount with OpenAPI**: `app.include_router(router, include_in_schema=True)`
- [ ] **Use descriptive tags**: `tags=["Banking"]` or `tags=["Market Data"]`
- [ ] **Store provider on app.state**: `app.state.{capability}_provider = provider`
- [ ] **Return provider instance**: `return provider` from `add_*()` helper
- [ ] **Accept provider instance OR name**: Handle both `provider="plaid"` and `provider=plaid_instance`

### 2. Documentation Cards (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **README card**: Section in main README.md with:
  - Overview (1-2 sentences)
  - Quick start code (3-5 lines)
  - Key use cases (bullet list)
  - Link to detailed docs
- [ ] **Dedicated doc file**: `docs/{capability}.md` with:
  - Feature overview
  - Provider comparison table
  - Configuration guide (env vars, parameters)
  - Complete API reference (all methods)
  - Integration examples with svc-infra
  - Error handling guide
  - Rate limits & quotas
  - Production checklist
- [ ] **OpenAPI visibility**: Verify capability appears in `/docs` with:
  - Proper tag grouping (separate card)
  - Security schemes shown correctly
  - Request/response models documented
  - Example values in schemas
- [ ] **ADR (when applicable)**: Create `docs/adr/{number}-{title}.md` for:
  - Provider selection rationale
  - Auth flow decisions
  - Data model choices
  - Security considerations
- [ ] **Integration examples**: Show real usage in docs:
  - Standalone usage (minimal)
  - Full integration (with svc-infra)
  - Production patterns (error handling, monitoring)
  - Testing examples (mocking)

### 3. Implementation Pattern (MANDATORY)
Every `add_*()` helper must follow this exact pattern:

```python
def add_{capability}(
    app: FastAPI,
    *,
    provider: str | {Provider}Type | None = None,
    prefix: str = "/{capability}",
    **config
) -> {Provider}Type:
    """Wire {capability} provider to FastAPI app."""
    from svc_infra.api.fastapi.dual.{public|protected} import {router_type}
    
    # Handle provider instance OR name
    if isinstance(provider, {Provider}Type):
        {instance} = provider
    else:
        {instance} = easy_{capability}(provider=provider, **config)
    
    # Create dual router (NOT APIRouter)
    router = {router_type}(prefix=prefix, tags=["{Capability} {Category}"])
    
    # Define routes
    @router.get("/endpoint")
    async def endpoint():
        return {instance}.method()
    
    # Mount with visibility
    app.include_router(router, include_in_schema=True)
    
    # Store and return
    app.state.{capability}_provider = {instance}
    return {instance}
```

### 4. Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Unit tests**: Mock provider responses, test logic
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Test FastAPI helper with TestClient
- [ ] **Acceptance tests**: Test against real provider APIs (sandboxes)
- [ ] **Router tests**: Verify dual route registration (with/without trailing slash)
- [ ] **OpenAPI tests**: Verify schema generation and security annotations

### Verification Checklist (Before Marking Section Complete)
Run through this checklist for each capability:
- [ ] ✅ Router uses svc-infra dual router (grep confirms no `APIRouter()`)
- [ ] ✅ README card exists with quick start
- [ ] ✅ Dedicated doc file comprehensive
- [ ] ✅ Visit `/docs` and confirm capability card appears
- [ ] ✅ ADR written (if applicable)
- [ ] ✅ Integration examples show fin-infra + svc-infra
- [ ] ✅ All tests passing (unit + integration + acceptance)
- [ ] ✅ Provider stored on `app.state`
- [ ] ✅ Helper returns provider instance
- [ ] ✅ Accepts both provider name and instance

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Using `from fastapi import APIRouter` (use svc-infra dual routers)
- ❌ Not mounting with `include_in_schema=True` (capability won't appear in docs)
- ❌ Generic tags like `["api"]` (use specific like `["Banking"]`)
- ❌ Not storing provider on `app.state` (routes can't access it)
- ❌ Not returning provider instance (no programmatic access)
- ❌ Only accepting provider name string (should accept instances too)
- ❌ No README card (capability not discoverable)
- ❌ No dedicated doc file (no comprehensive reference)
- ❌ Missing ADR for significant decisions (no rationale documented)

## Easy Setup Functions (One-Call Integration)

Like svc-infra's `easy_service_app()`, fin-infra provides simple one-liners for every financial capability:

### Provider Setup (Must-Haves 1-5, 13-14)
```python
# Provider registry - dynamic provider loading
from fin_infra.providers import easy_provider
provider = easy_provider("banking", "plaid")  # or ("market", "alphavantage")

# Banking aggregation (Plaid, Teller, MX)
from fin_infra.banking import easy_banking
banking = easy_banking(provider="teller")  # uses env vars by default

# Market data (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo, Polygon)
from fin_infra.markets import easy_market
market = easy_market(provider="alphavantage")  # zero config for yahoo

# Crypto data (CoinGecko, CCXT)
from fin_infra.crypto import easy_crypto
crypto = easy_crypto(provider="coingecko")  # no API key needed

# Brokerage (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers)
from fin_infra.brokerage import easy_brokerage
brokerage = easy_brokerage(provider="alpaca", mode="paper")  # safe default

# Credit scores (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion)
from fin_infra.credit import easy_credit
credit = easy_credit(provider="experian")  # sandbox by default

# Tax data (TaxBit for crypto, IRS for forms)
from fin_infra.tax import easy_tax
tax = easy_tax(provider="taxbit")  # sandbox by default
```

### Data Processing (Must-Haves 7, 15-17)
```python
# Symbol resolution & currency conversion
from fin_infra.normalization import easy_normalization
resolver, converter = easy_normalization()

# Transaction categorization (ML-based)
from fin_infra.categorization import easy_categorization
categorizer = easy_categorization(model="local")  # pre-trained model

# Recurring transaction detection
from fin_infra.recurring import easy_recurring_detection
detector = easy_recurring_detection()  # sensible defaults

# Net worth tracking
from fin_infra.net_worth import easy_net_worth
tracker = easy_net_worth()  # daily snapshots by default
```

### Security & Observability (Must-Haves 8-9)
```python
# Financial security extensions (PII masking, token encryption)
from fin_infra.security import add_financial_security
add_financial_security(app)  # extends svc-infra security

# Financial observability (provider metrics)
from fin_infra.obs import add_financial_observability
add_financial_observability(app)  # extends svc-infra metrics
```

### FastAPI Integration (Must-Have 10)
```python
# Full fintech API setup
from svc_infra.api.fastapi.ease import easy_service_app  # backend from svc-infra
from fin_infra.banking import add_banking
from fin_infra.markets import add_market_data
from fin_infra.credit import add_credit_monitoring

app = easy_service_app(name="FinanceAPI")
add_banking(app, provider="plaid")
add_market_data(app, provider="alphavantage")
add_credit_monitoring(app, provider="experian")
```

### Calculations (Cashflows module)
```python
# Financial calculations (no setup needed)
from fin_infra.cashflows import npv, irr, xnpv, xirr, pmt, fv, pv

net_value = npv(0.08, [-10000, 3000, 4000, 5000])
rate = irr([-10000, 3000, 4000, 5000])
```

**Design principle**: Every capability has an `easy_*()` or `add_*(app)` function that:
- Provides sensible defaults (sandbox mode, free tiers, env vars)
- Requires minimal configuration (zero config where possible)
- Returns fully configured objects ready to use
- Allows full customization via keyword arguments
- Integrates seamlessly with svc-infra (uses its cache, DB, jobs, logging)

- [~] Backend matrix: run acceptance against in‑memory + Redis (cache) profiles. (Reuse svc‑infra caching; Redis profile coverage is handled in svc‑infra contexts.)

### 0. Backfill Coverage for Base Modules (current repo)

Owner: TBD — Evidence: PRs, tests, CI runs
- [x] **Research (svc-infra check)**:
  - [x] Check svc-infra for settings patterns (pydantic-settings) → NOT NEEDED (fin-infra already has Settings with pydantic-settings)
  - [x] Check svc-infra.http for retry/timeout logic → FOUND: `svc_infra.http.new_httpx_client()` with retry support
  - [x] Check svc-infra.cache for caching patterns → FOUND: `init_cache()`, `cache_read`, `cache_write`, `add_cache()`
  - [x] Classification: Type C (mostly generic settings + financial models)
  - [x] Justification: Base settings from svc-infra; financial data models (Quote, Candle, Account, Transaction) are domain-specific
  - [x] Reuse plan: Use svc-infra.http for HTTP clients; use svc-infra.cache for provider caching; keep financial Pydantic models in fin-infra
  - [x] Evidence: svc-infra/src/svc_infra/http/client.py, svc-infra/src/svc_infra/cache/__init__.py
- Core: settings.py (timeouts/retries provided by svc‑infra; no local http wrapper)
- [x] Research: ensure pydantic‑settings (networking concerns covered in svc‑infra).
- [x] Skipped: unit tests for HTTP timeouts/retries (covered by svc‑infra).
- [x] Implement: Easy model exports - `from fin_infra.models import Account, Transaction, Quote, Candle` (already exists)
- [x] Tests: Unit tests for financial data models (validation, serialization) → tests/unit/test_models.py (20 tests passing)
- [x] Docs: quickstart for settings (link to svc‑infra for timeouts/retries & caching) + model reference → docs/getting-started.md (already comprehensive)
- Providers skeletons:
	- Market: providers/market/yahoo.py (proto) → swap to chosen vendor(s) below.
	- Crypto: providers/market/ccxt_crypto.py (proto)
	- Banking: providers/banking/plaid_client.py (proto) → replace with default pick.
	- Brokerage: providers/brokerage/alpaca.py (paper trading)

### 1. Provider Registry & Interfaces (plug‑and‑play)
- [x] **Research (svc-infra check)**:
  - [x] Check if svc-infra has provider registry pattern → NOT FOUND (not applicable for generic backend)
  - [x] Review svc-infra plugin/extension mechanisms → NOT FOUND (financial domain-specific)
  - [x] Classification: Type A (financial-specific provider discovery)
  - [x] Justification: Provider registry is financial domain-specific; svc-infra doesn't have financial provider concepts
  - [x] Evidence: fin-infra/src/fin_infra/providers/base.py already has ABCs for Banking, Market, Crypto, Brokerage, Identity, Credit
- [x] Research: ABCs for TaxProvider (add to existing base.py) → Added TaxProvider with get_tax_forms, get_tax_document, calculate_crypto_gains
- [x] Design: provider registry with domain:name mapping (resolve("banking", "teller")).
- [x] Implement: fin_infra/providers/registry.py loader with ProviderRegistry class
  - resolve(domain, name, **config) for dynamic loading
  - list_providers(domain) to discover available providers
  - Caching for performance
  - Default provider fallback per domain
- [x] Implement: Easy builder pattern - global resolve() function returns configured provider
- [x] Tests: dynamic import, provider listing, error handling, caching → tests/unit/test_provider_registry.py (19 tests passing)
- [~] Verify: All easy_* functions use registry internally (will implement with each provider in sections 2-5)
- [x] Docs: docs/providers.md with examples + configuration table + easy builder usage (comprehensive guide created)

### 2. Banking / Account Aggregation (default: Teller)
- [x] **Research (svc-infra check)**:
  - [x] Check svc-infra for banking/account aggregation modules → NOT FOUND (no banking APIs in svc-infra)
  - [x] Review svc-infra.billing for payment vs banking distinction → FOUND: svc-infra.billing is for usage tracking, subscriptions, invoicing (not bank aggregation)
  - [x] Check svc-infra.apf_payments → FOUND: For payment processing (Stripe/Adyen), NOT bank account aggregation
  - [x] Classification: Type A (financial-specific banking APIs)
  - [x] Justification: Banking aggregation (Plaid/Teller/MX) is financial domain-specific: linking bank accounts, fetching balances/transactions, identity verification. svc-infra.billing is for subscription billing, not financial account data.
  - [x] Reuse plan: Use svc-infra.cache for account/transaction caching (60s TTL), svc-infra.db for access token storage (encrypted), svc-infra.logging for provider call logging, svc-infra.http for retry logic
  - [x] Evidence: svc-infra has billing (subscriptions/invoices) and payments (Stripe/Adyen) but NO bank aggregation providers
- [x] Research: free dev tier limits, token exchange, accounts/transactions/balances endpoints, identity, statements.
  - Teller: 100 conn/mo free, 100 req/min, simple access token flow
  - Plaid: Free sandbox, $0.10-0.30/user prod, Link UI → public token → access token
  - MX: Enterprise pricing, Connect widget, 16k+ institutions
- [x] Research: Plaid vs Teller vs MX feature comparison (choose default + alternates).
  - **Default: Teller** (true free tier, simpler auth, US-only)
  - **Alternate 1: Plaid** (industry standard, broader coverage, production-ready)
  - **Alternate 2: MX** (enterprise-grade, comprehensive data)
- [x] Design: auth flow contracts; token storage interface; PII boundary. (ADR‑0003 — docs/adr/0003-banking-integration.md)
  - Auth flows documented (Teller direct, Plaid exchange)
  - Token storage: encrypted in svc-infra DB
  - PII: mask account numbers (last 4), mask routing numbers, never log SSN
  - Caching: 60s TTL for accounts, 5min for transactions (svc-infra cache)
- [x] Design: Easy builder signature: `easy_banking(provider="teller", **config)` with env auto-detection
  - Zero config: uses TELLER_API_KEY, PLAID_CLIENT_ID, etc from env
  - Returns configured BankingProvider from registry
  - FastAPI helper: `add_banking(app, provider=None, prefix="/banking")`
- [x] Implement: providers/banking/teller_client.py with real HTTP implementation (httpx)
  - TellerClient class with create_link_token, exchange_public_token, accounts, transactions, balances, identity
  - Full sandbox support with test credentials

## Tracking & Ordering

Prioritize Must‑have top→bottom. Interleave Quick Wins if they unlock infrastructure (e.g., retries/backoff before Alpha Vantage adapter if not using svc‑infra). Each section requires: Research complete → Design approved → Implementation + Tests → Verify → Docs.

## Notes / Decisions Log

Record ADRs for: provider registry, Alpha Vantage rate/backoff strategy (caching via svc‑infra if adopted), CoinGecko id mapping, order idempotency semantics, symbol normalization, SLOs/metrics taxonomy, PII/secret boundaries, CI gates.

**All ADRs must include a "svc-infra Reuse Assessment" section documenting:**
- What was checked in svc-infra
- Why svc-infra's solution was/wasn't suitable
- Which svc-infra modules are being reused (if any)

⸻

## svc-infra Reuse Tracking

Track all svc-infra imports and their usage:

### Already Integrated
- `svc-infra` dependency in pyproject.toml (path dependency for development)
- Backend infrastructure ready for use

### Planned Integrations (Must-have for v1)
- [ ] **Logging**: `from svc_infra.logging import setup_logging` in demo API
- [ ] **Caching**: `from svc_infra.cache import init_cache, cache_read, cache_write` for provider responses
- [ ] **API Scaffolding**: `from svc_infra.api.fastapi.ease import easy_service_app` in examples
- [ ] **Observability**: `from svc_infra.obs import add_observability` for provider metrics
- [ ] **HTTP Retry**: Use svc-infra's HTTP utilities for provider calls

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Create examples/demo_api/ showing full svc-infra + fin-infra integration
- [ ] Document in each provider's docs which svc-infra features to use
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common integration issues

⸻

## Global Verification & Finalization
- Run full pytest suite after each major category completion.
- Re‑run flaky markers (x3) to ensure stability.
- Update this checklist with PR links & skip markers (~) for existing features.
- **Verify svc-infra reuse**: Ensure no duplicate functionality exists in fin-infra
- **Integration tests**: Test fin-infra providers with svc-infra backend components
- **Template project verification**: Run `examples/fin-infra-template/` full setup and test all features
- Produce release readiness report summarizing completed items.
- Tag version & generate changelog.

Updated: Production‑readiness plan for fin‑infra with mandatory svc-infra reuse policy. fin-infra provides ONLY financial data integrations; ALL backend infrastructure comes from svc-infra.

⸻

## Update Summary (Must-Haves Standardization)

### Changes Made
1. **Mandatory Research Protocol Added to All Must-Haves (0-17)**
   - Each section now includes svc-infra check checklist
   - Classification (Type A/B/C) documented
   - Justification for fin-infra vs svc-infra placement
   - Reuse plan specifying which svc-infra modules to use

2. **Easy Setup Functions Documented for All Capabilities**
   - Provider setup: `easy_banking()`, `easy_market()`, `easy_crypto()`, `easy_brokerage()`, `easy_credit()`, `easy_tax()`
   - Data processing: `easy_normalization()`, `easy_categorization()`, `easy_recurring_detection()`, `easy_net_worth()`
   - Security/Observability: `add_financial_security(app)`, `add_financial_observability(app)`
   - FastAPI integration: `add_banking(app)`, `add_market_data(app)`, `add_credit_monitoring(app)`, etc.
   - All follow svc-infra pattern: one-call setup with sensible defaults + full flexibility

3. **New Must-Haves Added for Comprehensive Fintech Coverage (13-17)**
   - **#13 Credit Score Monitoring**: Experian/Equifax/TransUnion integration (Credit Karma functionality)
   - **#14 Tax Data Integration**: TaxBit (crypto), IRS forms, PDF parsing (tax season support)

4. **Section Renumbering**
   - Must-haves now: 0-17 (18 sections)
   - Nice-to-haves: 18-24 (7 sections)
   - Quick wins: 25 (1 section)

### Fintech App Coverage Verification
| App | Capabilities Covered | Must-Have Sections |
|-----|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Mint** | Account aggregation, categorization, recurring detection, budgeting | #2, #15, #16 |
| **Credit Karma** | Credit monitoring, scores, reports | #13 |
| **Robinhood** | Brokerage, trading, market data | #3, #4, #5 |
| **Personal Capital** | Net worth, portfolio, wealth management | #5, #17, Nice-to-have #19 |
| **YNAB** | Banking, categorization, recurring detection | #2, #15, #16 |
| **TurboTax/Tax Apps** | Tax forms, crypto tax reporting | #14 |

All must-haves now include:
- ✅ Research protocol with svc-infra check
- ✅ Easy setup function (`easy_*()` or `add_*(app)`)
- ✅ Clear classification (Type A/B/C)
- ✅ Justification for placement
- ✅ svc-infra reuse plan
- ✅ Comprehensive tests and docs sections

**Result**: fin-infra now provides complete fintech infrastructure while strictly delegating all backend concerns to svc-infra.

## Section 26: Complete Example/Template Project (Priority: High)

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive example project (`examples/fin-infra-template/`) that demonstrates ALL fin-infra capabilities integrated with svc-infra, similar to `svc-infra/examples/`. This serves as:
- Reference implementation for developers
- Integration testing for all providers
- Documentation through working code
- Starting point for new fintech projects

### Research
- [x] Review svc-infra examples structure (`svc-infra/examples/`)
  - Found: Complete template with main.py (754 lines), pyproject.toml, alembic setup, Makefile, QUICKSTART.md, SCAFFOLDING.md
  - Structure: src/svc_infra_template/ with api/, db/, models/, schemas/, settings.py
  - Features: All 18 svc-infra features demonstrated (auth, cache, jobs, webhooks, billing, observability, etc.)
  - Setup: `make setup` (scaffolding + migrations), `make run` (start server)
- [ ] **Research (svc-infra check)**:
  - [x] Examine svc-infra/examples/ comprehensive setup
  - [ ] Review svc-infra lifecycle management (startup/shutdown handlers)
  - [ ] Classification: Type C (Hybrid - fin-infra providers + svc-infra backend)
  - [ ] Justification: Example must show fin-infra financial integrations working with svc-infra backend framework
  - [ ] Reuse plan: Use svc-infra for ALL backend (FastAPI app, DB, cache, logging, metrics, auth), fin-infra ONLY for financial providers
